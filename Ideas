2. Unrecognized Inherent Bias in Training Data*
ML Model Idea:
An AI system designed to detect and mitigate bias in training datasets and predictions, ensuring fair and equitable outcomes across different demographic groups.

Key Features:

Bias Detection and Quantification: Analyzes training data and model outputs to identify disparities using fairness metrics like demographic parity or disparate impact.
Data Augmentation and Balancing: Enhances dataset diversity by oversampling underrepresented groups or using synthetic data generation (e.g., GANs).
Fairness-Aware Learning: Integrates fairness constraints during model training to minimize biased predictions.
Impact:
Mitigating bias in AI systems promotes social equity, ensures regulatory compliance, and increases public trust in AI by delivering fairer and more inclusive outcomes.

To inform and address visual training bias, you'll need datasets that provide diverse representations of people, objects, and environments to ensure inclusivity and fairness in computer vision applications. Here are some useful datasets:
